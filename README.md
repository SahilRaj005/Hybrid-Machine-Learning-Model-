#  Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Stock Price Prediction

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a Hybrid Machine Learning Model to predict stock prices by combining LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and XGBoost. The goal is to leverage both deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.

# Features

Hybrid Model Approach: Combines LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost for better accuracy.

Technical Indicators: Includes Moving Averages (SMA, EMA) for feature engineering.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized LSTM layers, dropout, and sequence lengths.

Comparative Analysis: Evaluates model performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score.

Visualization: Graphical representation of actual vs. predicted stock prices.
